This project was made in under 2 hours, as the actual documents that was build for this project was accidentally deleted 2 hours before submitted to the classroom. 

On this 1st project, Bootstrap grid system was used a lot to make the site look neat. It was used on on all pages for columns, navigation, headers, footers and so on. But it was not used on all sections.

There were a lot of unordered lists throughout, one of the example is on the navigation menu and social media icons on the footer. A table was also made in the About page of the site. Also, images were scattered on the sites such as on the header and footer.

One stylesheet was enough, and it was used to control paddings, margins, backgrounds, colors and so on. An scss stylesheet was also used with an example of variable to set the font, a nesting to set a button properties and an inheritance to add box shadow in some parts of the site.

Since, this site was made in less than two hours, considering the accident, the features are limited. The site was made to show a bucketlist that the author has, and promotes donations in order to make each bucketlist comes true.
